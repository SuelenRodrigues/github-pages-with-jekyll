In this first post I am going to add a little description of myself:
<p>My name is Suelen Rodrigues and I am in the process of changing careers.</p>
With a degree in Accounting Science, I have lived in a few countries and now I am learning about software development.<br>
I am a very curious person, very dedicated to what I do and the companies I work for. I am detail oriented, good analyst and a problem solver.<br>
I am looking for an opportunity to show my skills, collaborate with a team and keep learning about technology. <br>
This changing process started last year in February when I started a Higher Diploma course in Computing at Griffith College, Dublin.<br>
During this couse, I learned about Java programming language, Object Oriented Design and Web development.<br>
I felt that it was not enough and I needed further guidance, so I decided to start a Master in Computing right after receving my exam results, which, by the way, were 91 out of 100! <br>
During my MSc in Computing we are going to learn more about Java, Cloud Computing, Agile software development, Python and C programming language.<br>
I am also learning independently about JavaScript.
