title: "Suelen's introduction to Github pages"
---

Welcome to what it is supposed to be a blog page. ðŸ’»<br>
I am using this course to learn more about Github and start to actively use it to showcase my projects.
At first, for this course, I am not sure if I can simply use HTML here, how to add images, so it will be just text for now.
